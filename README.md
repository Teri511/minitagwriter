A quick and dirty tag making script to replace the ancient RadioShack Tag Wiz software.
Can be used to generate small and large tags for your friendly local RadioShack shop

requires the following python libraries: Pillow/xlrd

Instructions: Run the script via Python in a terminal/via command line with an Excel spreadsheet as its only argument or drag and drop the Excel file onto runme.bat

The ordering of the tag information is contained in the example Excel file "demo.xlsx"

tags should for now be printed in paint with all margins set as low as the can possibly go at 100% of size
